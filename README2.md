An ls-inspired CLI tool that shows files in the current directory, together with an opinionated list of photo and video media columns (resolution, GPS location). Either in a pretty, colorized, tabular mode, or a pseudo ls-style more suitable for text processing. 


Demo
====

ls-exif --tabular

ls-exif --ls


Remarks
=======

• Purely uses the extension for type detection. Will not find hidden JPEGs named .image
